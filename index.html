<p>An example how to use <code>NSLingusticTagger</code> to add syntax highlighting to natural language English text. Currently it highlights nouns, personal names and organization names in a body of text but you can easily hack it to tag other parts of speech. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Run the app and then a text document is displayed. By default the app pre-loads Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have a Dream" speech. You can replace the contents by pasting plain text or typing it directly in the editor window; however file load/save functions are not implemented as these are not relevant to the example.</p>

<p>Click on <em>Process</em> to invoke <code>NSLinguisticTagger</code> and then the document will be replaced with a read-only view that contains the syntax-highlighted document. This is a WebView and you can copy the text within and paste it to other application while retaining its formatting. To return to the editable view, just click on <em>Process</em> again.</p>

<h2>Hacking</h2>

<p>You'll want to look at <code>TextDocument.m</code> where most of the action takes place. To change what language parts are tagged, you'll want to modify the <code>renderText</code> method. There's a rather complete set of <code>if</code> statements commented out that encompasses a most of what <code>NSLinguisticTagger</code> is able to recognize out of English text. Just un-comment the tags that you want and then re-run the app. I've left most of them commented out since the output looks too distracting when all of those tags are colorized. </p>
